## TO make your variable global
```
$global:var_name= "This is global variable and aviable in the shell, outof the script"
```
## Set varibale- create new varibale if not exist or append the old one
```
Set-Variable -Name "myVar" -Value "Value of my variable"
```
## To create new var
```
Set-Variable -Name "myVar" -Value "Value of my variable"
```

## Get the list of all variable in current console
```
Get-Variable 
```

## to remove variable
```
Remove-varibale -name "MyVar"
```

## Get variable type
```
$MyVar.GetType()
```

## varibale with spaces and special character
```
${ give any var name &&88 } = "This is my new value"
```

## To make variable value constant
```
Set-Variable myVar -option Constant -Value "Value of my variable"
Set-Variable myVar -option ReadOnly -Value "Value of my variable"
```

## Powershell smart enough to decide the data type of variable


```
$Temp = 42
Write-Output = "Todays Temp is : $Temp"

Write-Output = 'Todays Temp is : $Temp'

Write-Output = "Todays Temp is : `$Temp"
```

## Some stirng concept
```
$string_var = "a Random String  "

$string_var.Length

$string_var.Contains("Random")

$string_var.Contains("random")

$string_var.IndexOf("Random")

$string_var.Trim()

$string_var.ToUpper()

$string_var.Replace("a" , "b")

$string_var.Replace("Random" , "Nice")
```

## To type multiline variable
```
$age = 42

$ans = @"
At your $age I earn nothing
so sorry
hope you understand
"@

echo $ans

$and = @'
At your $age I earn nothing
so sorry
hope you understand
'@

echo $and
```

## validate your data type
```
$myVar -is [int]
```

## to get method of any varibale
```
$var = "school"

$var | Get-Member
```
## method 1: Once, we have declared variable as Integer type, we cannot change its type again.
```
[int]$x=100 
$x.GetType()
```

## Method2: We can re-use the same variable again & again with different data types
```
$y=[int]100 
$y.GetType()
$y = "a String Value"
$y.GetType()
```
